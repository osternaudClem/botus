# BOTUS

**Botus** is a Discord bot that roll dices. I created it to be the most simpliest and to use it for our Discord RPG server.

[Add Botus to your Discord](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1016699178061139968&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## Commands

```
!d: Roll 1 dice from 0 to 100
!d20: Roll 1 dice from 0 to 20
!2d: Roll 2 dices from 0 to 100
!3d50: Roll 3 dices from 0 to 50
```
